# Genkit Hands-on

## Intro
Duration: 0:01:00

In this codelab, you’ll start with the initial setup of Genkit, then operate features like Code Execution and Function Calling in a local environment. Although it’s very straightforward, this codelab experience will show you how efficiently you can develop using Genkit.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- npm

## Get Gemini API key
Duration: 0:02:00

Please access the following site to get the Gemini API key.

* [Get API key | Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

As of November 2024, the free plan of the Gemini API is sufficient for this hands-on session, so there’s no need for a paid plan.

* [Pricing models | Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)

Run the following curl command in your terminal, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key, and confirm that a response is successfully returned.

```sh
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Explain Firebase in under 100 words."}]}]}' \
  -X POST 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY'
```

If you're using Windows, please confirm with the following command on PowerShell.
```PowerShell
curl `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Explain Firebase in under 100 words."}]}]}' `
  -X POST 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Hello Genkit!
Duration: 0:05:00

In this section, we’ll run Genkit locally with its minimal configuration. Run the following commands to initialize the project.

```sh
mkdir hello-genkit && cd hello-genkit
npm init -y
npm i -D genkit-cli
npm i genkit @genkit-ai/googleai @genkit-ai/express
```

Set the Gemini API key you obtained earlier as an environment variable.

```sh
export GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

If you're using Windows, set the Gemini API key as an environment running the following command on PowerShell.
```PowerShell
$env:GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

Please create `src/index.ts` file and paste the following code.

```javaScript
import { genkit, z } from 'genkit'
import { googleAI, gemini15Flash } from '@genkit-ai/googleai'
import { startFlowServer } from '@genkit-ai/express'
import { logger } from 'genkit/logging'
logger.setLogLevel('debug')

const ai = genkit({
  plugins: [googleAI()],
  model: gemini15Flash,
})

const mainFlow = ai.defineFlow({
  name: 'mainFlow',
  inputSchema: z.string(),
}, async (input) => {
  const { text } = await ai.generate(input)
  return text
})

startFlowServer({ flows: [mainFlow] })
```

Genkit will start with the following command, and Developer Tools will automatically launch.

```sh
npx genkit start -o -- npx tsx --watch src/index.ts
```

In the Flows menu, select `mainFlow` defined in the code above. Enter a string and select the `Run` button to send a prompt to Gemini.

* Prompt: `Explain Firebase in under 100 words.`

![Hello Genkit! | Flow](img/en/hello-genkit-flow.png)

Press the `View trace` button to see detailed Input and Output from the Gemini API.

## Code Execution
Duration: 0:03:00

With Gemini’s Code Execution, you can generate and execute Python code. Only one line needs to be changed.

```javascript
-  model: gemini15Flash,
+  model: gemini15Flash.withConfig({ codeExecution: true }),
```

Open Developer Tools, input prompts that require programming into mainFlow, and try the following requests:

* `Simulate the ratio of heads to tails after flipping a coin 100,000 times.`
* `Calculate the 100th Fibonacci number.`
* `Execute the following code in Python: print('Hello World')`

Here is the result.

In the View trace menu, you can see the Python code that was executed.

### Challenge
Try thinking up prompts that require Code Execution and give them a try.

## Function Calling
Duration: 0:05:00

Function Calling allows generative AI to call predefined functions as needed to fulfill user requests. Here are some possible use cases:

* Extracting content from URLs or PDFs included in user requests.
* Calling external APIs, such as:
  * Adding to a calendar
  * Sending notifications to a chat service
  * Searching internal documents
  * Google search

In this codelab, you’ll implement a tool to extract the contents of a URL and try calling it with Function Calling using [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) as the HTML parser.

```sh
npm i cheerio
```

Remove Code Execution for now.

```javascript
-  model: gemini15Flash.withConfig({ codeExecution: true }),
+  model: gemini15Flash,
```

Import cheerio.

```javascript
  import { genkit, z } from 'genkit'
  import { googleAI, gemini15Flash } from '@genkit-ai/googleai'
+ import * as cheerio from 'cheerio'
```

Add the following function under the definition of the `ai` variable in `src/index.ts`. The first argument specifies the tool’s configuration values, and the second argument specifies the process to execute.

```javascript
const webLoader = ai.defineTool(
  {
    name: "webLoader",
    description:
      "When a URL is received, it accesses the URL and retrieves the content inside.",
    inputSchema: z.object({ url: z.string() }),
    outputSchema: z.string(),
  },
  async ({ url }) => {
    const res = await fetch(url)
    const html = await res.text()
    const $ = cheerio.load(html)
    $("script, style, noscript").remove()
    if ($("article")) {
      return $("article").text()
    }
    return $("body").text()
  },
)
```

Specify `tools` in the `generate` method parameter and include `webLoader` in the array. Since `tools` can be specified as an array, you can set multiple tools, and generative AI will select the necessary tool for execution based on the `description` in `defineTool`. Just like prompt engineering, tuning description is essential.

```javascript
-  const { text } = await ai.generate(input)
+  const { text } = await ai.generate({ prompt: input, tools: [webLoader] })
```

The final source code can be found at the following GitHub URL.

[https://github.com/tanabee/genkit-codelab/blob/main/steps/function-calling/src/index.ts](https://github.com/tanabee/genkit-codelab/blob/main/steps/function-calling/src/index.ts)

Now that the code is complete, open Developer Tools. You’ll see that webLoader has been added to the Tools menu. Select webLoader, enter the following URL, and execute it.

URL: [https://medium.com/firebase-developers/implementing-function-calling-using-genkit-0c03f6cb9179](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/implementing-function-calling-using-genkit-0c03f6cb9179)

![Function Calling | Tool](img/en/function-calling-tool.png)

The content of the URL was extracted. In Genkit Developer Tools, you can test tools individually to verify their functionality before incorporating them into a Flow, making development more efficient.

Next, select mainFlow from the Flow menu. Enter the following prompt and execute it.

Prompt: `First, fetch the content inside URL. Next, summarize the content in less than 200 words. https://medium.com/firebase-developers/implementing-function-calling-using-genkit-0c03f6cb9179`

You can see that the content has been summarized based on the extracted content.

![Function Calling | Flow](img/en/function-calling-flow.png)

Look at the View trace. You’ll see that while two requests were made to the Gemini API, webLoader was called in between, confirming that the tool was indeed called.

### Challenge

Try defining your own tools and implementing Function Calling.
